## Kafka 2.5 Consistency Experiments on Kubernetes

This repository contains sample code for simulating a 2.5 DC setup of Kafka on Kubernetes where a Kubernetes namespace is used for simulating a data center. 
Data center network disconnection is simulated by Kubernetes network policies. The problem with network policies is, however, that they do no interrupt existing connections.
